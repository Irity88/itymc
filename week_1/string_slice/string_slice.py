#to be honest I haven't understood the task since it has very unclear explanation so I've just played around with slicing
# TODO: [Mykyta]: 
# Create python program which accepts input string `s`, 
# `start` index, `end` index and prints substring (from start to end) to console in `string_slice.py`.
# So "string_slice" is `s`, `start` is "0", `end` index is "2" in your case, just accept those as input as well :)
