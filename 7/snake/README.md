This challenge needs to be done step by step.
You have initial `snake.py`, which covers first step:
* [1. Add Initial Snake Game classes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/100)

Now, you need to implement other steps :) For traceability, better to do a commit after each step.

* [2. Add basic methods for Snake & Game classes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/101)
* [3. Rework Game rendering logic using sleep](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/102)
* [4. Next possible positions for Snake](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/103)
* [5. Add Apple](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/107)
* [6. Find new place for an Apple eaten by Snake](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/110)
* [7. Rework play method to have some game cycles](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/111)
* [8. Distance to Apple](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/113)
* [9. Final changes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/114)

That's it!

(*) Ideally, you can try to add [unit tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI) to it.

(**) For those who wants to add user interaction, you can try to adapt the idea to your code from:
