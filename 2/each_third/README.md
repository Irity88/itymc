# Task 11
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
   ```shell
   # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of characters` and prints `list of each third element` to console in `each_third.py`.
   ```shell
   # 3, 2, 1, 4, 5,  2, ss, q
   # ['3', '1', '5', 'ss']
   ```
   Note, the input sequence may contain blank spaces around values, but output list should not have blank spaces!

   ```shell
   git add week_2/each_third/each_third.py
   git commit -m "each third (task 11)"
   git push
   ```
