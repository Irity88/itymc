# Task 10
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
   ```shell
   # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of numbers` and prints `sorted list` to console in `sort_numbers.py`.
   ```shell
   # Input: 3, 2, 1, 4, 5,  2
   # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```
   Note, the numbers should not be sorted as numbers (not strings)
3. Commit your changes.
   ```shell
   git add week_2/sort_numbers/sort_numbers.py
   git commit -m "sort numbers (task 10)"
   git push
   ```
