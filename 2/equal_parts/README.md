# Task 12
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
   ```shell
   # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of characters` and `splits it on 2 (mostly) equal parts` to console in `equal_parts.py`.
   ```shell
   # 3, 2, 1, 4, 5,  2, ss, q
   # ['3', ' 2', ' 1', ' 4'] [' 5', '  2', ' ss', ' q']
   ```
   Note, parts may not be exactly equal if it's not possible!
3. Commit your changes.
   ```shell
   git add week_2/equal_parts/equal_parts.py
   git commit -m "equal parts (task 12)"
   git push
   ```
