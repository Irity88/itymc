# Task 18

Refactor `movie_picker.py` in order to minimize code duplication.

For example, manipulations with genres or cast look ups could be extracted to single function:
```python
def search(source, source_name):
    # value: accept as input from user
    # search for value in the source until found
    # return value, once found
    ...
```
