This challenge needs to be done step by step.
You have initial `snake.py`, which covers first step:
* [Add Initial Snake Game classes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/100)

Now, you need to implement other steps :) For traceability, better to do a commit after each step.

* [Add basic methods for Snake & Game classes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/101)
* [Rework Game rendering logic using sleep](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/102)
* [Next possible positions for Snake](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/103)
* [Add Apple](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/107)
* [Find new place for an Apple eaten by Snake](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/110)
* [Rework play method to have some game cycles](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/111)
* [Distance to Apple](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/113)
* [Final changes](https://github.com/mykytapavlov/python-beginner/issues/114)

That's it!

(*) Ideally, you can try to add unit tests to it.

(**) For those who wants to add user interactions, you can try to adapt the idea to your code from:
[Snake in the powershell / terminal (with python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAIawk2IVIM)

Do not hesitate to ask questions!
